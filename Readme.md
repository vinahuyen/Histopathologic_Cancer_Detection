Histopathologic Cancer DetectionThis project tackles the Kaggle competition Histopathologic Cancer Detection, which focuses on identifying metastatic cancer in histopathologic lymph node images. Each image is a small 96x96 pixel patch extracted from a larger whole-slide image. The task is a binary classification problem predicting whether the image contains tumor tissue (`1`) or not (`0`).The accompanying report (`Histopathologic_Cancer_Detection.html`) provides exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, modeling steps, evaluation, and visualizations related to the classification task.---Project OverviewObjectiveTo develop a machine learning model—primarily using convolutional neural networks (CNNs)—to classify histopathology image patches as cancerous or non-cancerous.DatasetSource: Kaggle – Histopathologic Cancer DetectionEach image is:Size: 96 × 96 pixelsFormat: RGBLabels:`1` → Contains cancer`0` → Normal tissue---Project Structure---Methodology1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)The analysis includes:Visual inspection of sample cancerous and non-cancerous patchesImage size and distribution overviewPixel intensity statisticsClass balance examinationKey findings:Dataset is relatively balancedCancerous patches often show structural irregularities and darker nuclei patterns---2. Data PreprocessingSteps include:Image normalizationResizing (ensure consistency across models)Data augmentation such as:Horizontal/vertical flipsRotationsZoomingColor jitterAugmentation helps prevent overfitting due to small image size.---3. ModelingA Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach is used, typically including:Convolutional layersBatch normalizationMax poolingDropout regularizationFully connected dense layers for classificationOptimizers experimented:AdamRMSpropLoss function:Binary Cross-EntropyEvaluation metrics:AccuracyROC-AUCConfusion matrix---ResultsKey results covered in the HTML report:Training/validation accuracy curvesROC curve and AUC scorePredictions on sample test patchesDiscussion of overfitting/underfitting behavior---How to Run1.
